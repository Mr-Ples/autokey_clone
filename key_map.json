So far so bussin' fr fr no cap.\n\nIn the first picture you are showing your plot which is on someone elses land cuh ong fr, there the generation is 9 crypton per day (from the land itself, see the metaverse article cos.support.metaverse#metaverse), and whatever comes from the landlord's NFT collection to you (so if the land lord has an NFT pet for example 10% of what the pet generates goes to the plot managers, and you get a cut because you are a plot manager).

The overview should show the scholarship + the plot = ~511 skrrt say less.\n\nIf this explanation didn't go brrr ong fr feel free to reach out again rent free cuh ong.

Notifications are often wrong when transactions fail. Simply retrying to purchase the deal should work and you will receive the rewards. If you have been charged for something that is not in your purchase history we would need you to provide the transaction ID. For Google Play you can find the transaction id in your email or by following instructions on this link: https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2850369?hl=en. For Apple you can find the transaction ID (called the Document number) also in your email or by following these steps: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204088. In addition to the transaction ID we need to know the following: 1) The account of the purchase 2) The date of the purchase 3) The boost that was purchased. Looking forward to your response. If you suspect any double charge its better to provide the transaction ID to us, requesting a chargeback with your bank or a refund on the Store will result in your account being striked, which could lead to various penalties.

Most users report referrals to be working fine and the issue is an extremely difficult issue to solve. If you are not a free-to-play user the best option is to purchase the TTTT boost, referrals and community additions from this boost do not rely on the 3rd party service and will work.
